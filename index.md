# Eliana Bower

I'm a second year Marine Biology major and Sustainability Studies minor at the University of California, Santa Cruz. I'm driven by my passion for the ocean and protecting the environment around us. My career goal is to help mitigate the effects of climate change and expand the knowledge of what we currently know about the ocean.
